I have commented lu-non-worksharing.cpp in detail(I did not comment the other two as most parts are exactly the same).
Each program takes three arguments, the dimention of matrix A, the number of threads and verification(0 means no verification).
To run the program, i.e. ./xxxx 8000 32 0
To check correctness, i.e. ./xxxx 1000 8 1
