To run the program, please do the following:
moduel load OpenMPI
make
srun -n<number of nodes> mul <size of square matrix> <c> <verification>

i.e. srun -n 32 mul 7500 2 0 if you would like to test the performance of 7500 by 7500 matrix multiplication on 32 cores.

srun -n 32 mul 1000 2 1 if you would like to verify the correctness of implementation.
